The client said:
>Hello! I’m looking for a simple 2D/3D sidescroller platformer game (2D sprites or 3D models - Must be sidescrolling).
>I want to focus on the art and I’m not so good with programming.
>I would need the game to be laid out in a way I could make levels, and enemies, control a player, and create pickups

> I want to be quoted in your Markdown wiki.
> This is how you do it.
> Did you know that?
