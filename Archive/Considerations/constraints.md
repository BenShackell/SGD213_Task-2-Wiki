# Constraints 

## Development Constraints

Time constraints - Time needs to be managed correctly so we can meet all the needs of our clientsâ€™ requests. The deadline for this project is Tuesday the 28th of May 2024.

Budget constraints - can affect the scope and the quality of the game. The agreement between the team and client for what deliverables and in amount of time for $ quoted and agreed price.

Technical limitations - Scope creep - adding in features that were not in the original agreement. Lack of funding - this can restrict the budget for publishing and polishing the game. 

Technical Challenges - coding, debugging, ensuring cross platform compatibility, making sure the client is happy with the performance.

Platform limitations - Different platforms have varying technical specification requirements.
