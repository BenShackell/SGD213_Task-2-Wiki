Hello Olexiy 

Thank you for choosing Crow Studio, we look forward to working with you. We have made a list of what you originally requested.

You would like to focus on the artwork yourself.
2D or 3D - Similar to Mario Games - must be side scrolling

walk 
run 
jump 
be damaged
enemies
pick ups

Would you like to give damage? and how will the player do this?
how many enemies will you need? will they give different amounts of damage to the player?
Do you have any artwork available for testing purposes? are you ok for us to place in some until you can replace with your own?
will you need sound?
We have been calling your game Kenny the Kid, what did you want to call your game?

Hi Belinda,

I'm happy with the player not being able to deal damage to enemies, though if you have the time, you could add an ability to do so. Jumping on top of them, like Mario games would be suitable for the genre.
I will be able to configure enemy damage amounts in Editor, so a generic setup for enemies to deal damage upon contact with the player will be sufficient.
I am not able to provide testing art at this time, so feel free to use placeholder art in the meantime, and no sound is required. I also have not decided on the name, so placeholder title is perfectly fine!

Looking forward to the project,
Olexiy.

Hi Ben,

The target audience would be classic platformer players, likely in 25-34 range.
The entity speeds would be something I'll playtest and iterate on, so feel free to use placeholder values for now as I'll be able to change them in Editor later!

Olexiy.

Good evening Olexiy, this is Tyrell from Crow Studio

I have added an area where you will be able to sign and seal the deal with Crow Studio to get your project moving. 
Crow Studio is finalised and ready. Waiting for you to sign so we can commence building the game you desire. 

Note that there may be some hiccups along the way through production but 
we are here step by step to ensure that you are getting what you are asking for. 

For any questions, please feel free to email either one of us on the team if you are having any doubts or regrets. 
As always don't forget to print out this contract and sign, when you are ready email the signature back to us so that 
we may begin. 

This contract is made for Olexiy and crow studio will ensure that Kenny the kid project (placeholder name) will be finished. 
Please read over the report to ensure there are no discrepancies within the contract.

The description of the game: 

Players will enjoy the fast passed visuals and nostalgia of a 2d side scrolling game called Kenny the Kid. The main character is a small kid. They will be running, jumping and will need to defeat enemies by throwing fire balls at them along their journey. The main goal is to get the key after defeating the boss enemy. Players will explore the levels, defeat enemies, try to stay alive.

Begin Date:

18/04/2024

End Date:

31/05/2024

Requirements: 

-Needs the product 31 May 2024.

-Gameplay should be fast paced

-Should be quick to restart

-Feedback is a major point

-People should be drawn to it by its appearance

-Needs a catchy name (Kenny the Kid) - place holder name

-Programming completed to allow client to easily add artwork and design the level

-Programming will allow client to change the amount of damage the enemies give

Expectations that will be met:

-Project delivered on time

-Weekly updates on progress

-Communication with the client when design issues encountered

-Quality transparent project management (Olexiy - Mimtendo)

-Does not require audio

-Does not require high quality art - use place holder art

-Can use basic geometry

-Should still look nice using colour palettes

-Walk

-Run

-Jump

-Be damaged - damage will be on collision - ability to change damage amount in editor


-Enemies

-Pick ups

Assumptions:

-UI art does not need to be high quality, will just use basic Unity UI sprites

-Programming the player, levels and enemies will be important, but since we shouldn't spend time on art, will use standard asset or free assets - PLACE HOLDER

-Client would like Crow studio to implement all programming in a way that they can add art easily and make damage amount changes in the editor.

-In the expectations we have listed what the client has requested, if the team have time we could add in more movement functions to allow the game to function like the Mario games to help the client achieve the end result they need.

Schedule of Rates:

Crow Studio will be on a tight time frame and cannot work past the completion date. We will allocate 3 programmers to the game at a rate of $40 per hour. Each programmer will be working on the game for 10 hours per week. The total cost will be $4800.

Milestones:

//: # (Breakdown of phases of development, with estimated delivery times) 
//: # (In practice, if you were working on fixed price phases, you would also list expected payment after each phase.)

              Phase:                               Completion Date:
      all expectations by                               Week 13

Agreement:

Work will be completed to fit the provided Statement of Works, if the team wish to implement extra movement functions within the original time frame set they can do so under the original quote agreed by the client. Any additional programming work outside of this arrangement will be billed at our hourly rate or quoted separately.
