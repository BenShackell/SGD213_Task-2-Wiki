>This is all sample material in here, to give you an idea on how and what to populate each section with. If you think of other sections or a different document layout, please do use it!

## Design
[//]: # (How will you meet the client's brief, their expectations, and their requirements.)

### Project Name
Platformer, Adventure

### Description
[//]: # (This is the elevator pitch, sell the idea)
Players will enjoy the fast passed visuals and nostalgia of a 2d side scrolling game called Kenny the Kid.
The main character is a small kid. They will be running, jumping and will need to defeat enemies by throwing fire balls at them along their journey.
The main goal is to get the key after defeating the boss enemy. Players will explore the levels, defeat enemies, try to stay alive. 


### Begin Date

## Statement of Works
[//]: # (This section is about managing expectations; list out all of the qualities that will be in the final product)

### Requirements
[//]: # (What are the requirements of the finished project?)
* Needs the product in 5 weeks.
* Gameplay should be fast-paced
* Should be quick to restart
* Feedback is a major point
* People should be drawn to it by it's appearance
* Needs a catchy name

### Expectations
[//]: # (What are the client's expectations?)
* Project delivered on time
* Weekly updates on progress
* Communication with the client when design issues encountered
* Quality transparent project management (add the client)
* Does **not** require audio
* Does **not** require high quality art
* Can use basic geometry
* Should still look nice using colour palettes

### Assumptions
[//]: # (What are you assuming based on client responses)
* UI art does not need to be high quality, will just use basic Unity UI sprites
* Programing the player, levels and enemies will be important, but since we shouldn't spend time on art, will use standard asset or free assets
