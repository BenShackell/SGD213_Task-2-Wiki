Hello Olexiy 

Thank you for choosing Crow Studio, we look forward to working with you. We have made a list of what you originally requested.

You would like to focus on the artwork yourself.
2D or 3D - Similar to Mario Games - must be side scrolling

walk 
run 
jump 
be damaged
enemies
pick ups

Would you like to give damage? and how will the player do this?
how many enemies will you need? will they give different amounts of damage to the player?
Do you have any artwork available for testing purposes? are you ok for us to place in some until you can replace with your own?
will you need sound?
We have been calling your game Kenny the Kid, what did you want to call your game?

Hi Belinda,

I'm happy with the player not being able to deal damage to enemies, though if you have the time, you could add an ability to do so. Jumping on top of them, like Mario games would be suitable for the genre.
I will be able to configure enemy damage amounts in Editor, so a generic setup for enemies to deal damage upon contact with the player will be sufficient.
I am not able to provide testing art at this time, so feel free to use placeholder art in the meantime, and no sound is required. I also have not decided on the name, so placeholder title is perfectly fine!

Looking forward to the project,
Olexiy.
