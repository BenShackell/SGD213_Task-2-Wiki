# Risk Assessment 

## Risk Register

Unity and C# are excellent prototyping tools, but working quickly often means less than perfect code

Project may not be fit for use in further development

Bugs may be present in prototype due to the short turn-around

Working quickly is error-prone

Deadline - Time management - staff becoming sick, client needing more programming added. The team not creating the what the client has requested. Or confusion with the request. Client changing the required

deliverables. The team will do their best to keep lines of communication open, we will be checking off each requested deliverable. 

Legal or copyright issues - ensuring any assets provided are free for use and are acceptable under fair use legality and maintaining documentation of any third-party assets used to manage any possible copyright issues.

Damaged or faulty equipment - Computer crashing or malfunction slowing progress. The team will use GitHub to save work progress and back up files often.

Technical Issues - Communication between the client and the team ensuring we are maximising work output. If issues do come up the client and team can resolve asap via email, discord, or Trello.
