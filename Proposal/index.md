# Project Overview
[//]: # (This section is an example structure for the proposal to your client.)

>This is all sample material in here, to give you an idea on how and what to populate each section with. If you think of other sections or a different document layout, please do use it!

## Design
[//]: # (How will you meet the client's brief, their expectations, and their requirements.)

### Project Name
Platformer, Adventure

### Description
[//]: # (This is the elevator pitch, sell the idea)
Players will enjoy the fast passed visuals and nostalgia of a 2d side scrolling game called Kenny the Kid.
The main character is a small kid. They will be running, jumping and will need to defeat enemies by throwing fire balls at them along their journey.
The main goal is to get the key after defeating the boss enemy. Players will explore the levels, defeat enemies, try to stay alive. 


### Begin Date
18/04/2024

### End Date
31/05/2024

### Justification
Read the design justification [here](project_justification.md).

## Statement of Works
[//]: # (This section is about managing expectations; list out all of the qualities that will be in the final product)

### Requirements
[//]: # (What are the requirements of the finished project?)
* Needs the product 31 May 2024.
* Gameplay should be fast paced
* Should be quick to restart
* Feedback is a major point
* People should be drawn to it by its appearance
* Needs a catchy name (Kenny the Kid) - place holder name
* Programming completed to allow client to easily add artwork and design the level
* Programming will allow client to change the amount of damage the enemies give 

### Expectations
[//]: # (What are the client's expectations?)
* Project delivered on time
* Weekly updates on progress
* Communication with the client when design issues encountered
* Quality transparent project management (Olexiy - Mimtendo)
* Does **not** require audio
* Does **not** require high quality art - use place holder art
* Can use basic geometry
* Should still look nice using colour palettes
* Walk 
* Run 
* Jump 
* Be damaged - Damage will be on collision - ability to change damage amount in editor
* Give damage - by jumping on top (only if there is time not required)
* Enemies
* Pick ups

### Assumptions
[//]: # (What are you assuming based on client responses)
* UI art does not need to be high quality, will just use basic Unity UI sprites
* Programming the player, levels and enemies will be important, but since we shouldn't spend time on art, will use standard asset or free assets - PLACE HOLDER
* Client would like Crow studio to implement all programming in a way that they can add art easily and make damage amount changes in the editor.
* In the expectations we have listed what the client has requested, if the team have time we could add in more movement functions to allow the game to function like the Mario games to help the client achieve the end result they need.

[//]: # (### Schedule of Rates)
[//]: # (This is where you would list your hourly rates and time estimations)
## Schedule of Rates
Crow Studio will be on a tight time frame and cannot work past the completion date.
We will allocate 3 programmers to the game at a rate of $40 per hour. 
Each programmer will be working on the game for 10 hours per week. 
the total cost will be $4800.

## Milestones
[//]: # (Breakdown of phases of development, with estimated delivery times)
[//]: # (In practice, if you were working on fixed price phases, you would also list expected payment after each phase.)
| Phase | Completion Date |
| --- | --- |
| all expectations by | Week 13 |

---

## Agreement
[//]: # (List out the arrangement)
Work will be completed to fit the provided Statement of Works, if the team wish to implement extra movement functions within the original time frame set they can do so under the original quote agreed by the client. any additional programming work outside of this arrangement will be billed at our hourly rate or quoted separately. 

## Signatures
[//]: # (If dealing in person, agreements should be signed so that additional work can be billed)
